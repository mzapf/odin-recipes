        <h1>Creamy Mushroom Risotto</h1>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>1 quart chicken or vegetable broth, warmed</li>
            <li>1 cup finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 lb mushrooms, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white wine</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large pot, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
                Add the onion and garlic, saut√©ing until they are translucent,
                about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the rice and stir to coat with the butter. Cook for 2
                minutes, then pour in the wine and cook until the wine is fully
                absorbed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the mushrooms and another tablespoon of butter. Cook until
                the mushrooms are soft, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Begin adding the warmed broth one ladle at a time, allowing the
                rice to absorb the liquid before adding more. Stir frequently,
                and continue to add broth until the rice is tender and creamy,
                about 18-20 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the remaining butter, Parmesan cheese, and season with
                salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh parsley before
                serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
